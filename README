BlackBerry Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Setup
=====

BlackBerry OS version used is **7.1.0**.

Should you have an older version of BlackBerry OS, see `Install BlackBerry OS 
7.1.0 in Eclipse`_.

1) Create a Blackberry project called *SurvivorPoolClient* in Eclipse. 

2) Delete the ``src/`` folder in the project and copy *all* the files from the
   client jar file.

3) Run BlackBerryApp.java

4) Map the SD card to the folder that contains ``res/`` folder for the
   Administrator client, not the BlackBerry client side. The res folder is found
   in the same folder as the ``Group2Standalone.jar`` file. See `Setup SD Card 
   for BlackBerry Simulator`_ for more detailed instructions.


**Note:**
  The season must be started (Administrator side) to be able to log into the 
  BlackBerry client (warning shows up).

    that it could be reloaded again. This must be persistent (the user should 
    only have to load the players once).
